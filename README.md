#### Excel_Applications
User forms created in excel using VBA and macros.

##### 'Distance_Calculator_-_USA_UK' -
User form calculates the distance between 2 cities as the crow flies. Users can type and search or select cities, states/ regions from the drop-down menu.

##### 'Organizer12' -
User form supports adding/ deleting categories (12), adding/ deleting, and searching for and replacing records.

##### 'Profitability_Analysis_-_Monte_Carlo_Simulation' -
User form predicts the probability of different outcomes with the intervention of random variables. Users must not change the data in the 'Main' spreadsheet - it will corrupt the user form. By pressing the 'RunSimulation' button, the user can change the number of simulations and distributions inside the user form.

##### Code can be adjusted, depending on needs.
